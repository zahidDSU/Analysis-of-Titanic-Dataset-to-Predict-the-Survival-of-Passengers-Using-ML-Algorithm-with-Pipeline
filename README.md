# Analysis-of-Titanic-Dataset-to-Predict-the-Survival-of-Passengers-Using-ML-Algorithm-with-Pipeline

# Project Overview
The "Analysis of Titanic Dataset for Survival Prediction" project is a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers on the infamous RMS Titanic. The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers' demographics and other attributes.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes details of passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, ticket class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, cabin, port of embarkation, and, most importantly, survival status. This dataset is a classic in the data science and machine learning community, providing an opportunity to explore data analysis and apply machine learning algorithms for survival prediction.

# Key Attributes:
PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Represents the passenger's ticket class.
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Passenger's gender.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Fare paid.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation.
